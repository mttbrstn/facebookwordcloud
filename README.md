# facebookwordcloud
A hacky python script for generating a word cloud from Facebook's data dump

You'll want to change the following settings before running:

1) "FILE" should be set to your wall.htm location

2) "IMAGE" should be set to the image you are using for the color palate (see https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud for more information)

3) "FONT" should be set to the font you want to use
